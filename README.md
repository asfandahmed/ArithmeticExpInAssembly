ArithmeticExpInAssembly
=======================
It is a program in assembly language which solves arithmetic expresssion at limit.
The code works fine if your result is equal to 9 or blow 9.
The prgram uses TWO-Stack E.W. Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the arithmetic expression. I 've implemented it on a single stack.
